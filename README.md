# Raven_HiveOS_Full_Node

Install script for HiveOS Linux to run Ravencoin Full node with disabled wallet, with automatic restart at boot/reboot using systemd service (thanks PapaChurbz for systemd configuration)

This is a "one-click" installation and configuration script for HiveOS Linux.

The intention of this is to help support/strengthen the Ravencoin network. A lot of us have mining rigs that are running 24/7 and could be running a full node as well.

Please see my [install guide on Medium](https://medium.com) for caveats, warnings, and detailed copy/paste setup.
